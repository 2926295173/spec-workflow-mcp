## Quick Start

1. **Add to your AI tool configuration** (see MCP Client Setup below):
   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "spec-workflow": {
         "command": "npx",
         "args": ["-y", "@pimzino/spec-workflow-mcp@latest", "/path/to/your/project"]
       }
     }
   }
   ```

2. **Start using the workflow:**
   - Use `spec-workflow-guide` tool first to understand the complete process
   - Use `steering-guide` tool to create project steering documents (optional)
   - Monitor progress via the automatic web dashboard (opens automatically for each project)

    }
  }
}
```

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "spec-workflow": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@pimzino/spec-workflow-mcp@latest", "/path/to/your/project"]
    }
  }

## Web Dashboard

The server includes a real-time web dashboard that automatically opens in your browser when you start the MCP server. Each project gets its own dedicated dashboard running on an ephemeral port. The dashboard provides:

- **Live Project Overview** - Real-time updates of specs and progress
- **Document Viewer** - Read requirements, design, and tasks documents
- **Task Progress Tracking** - Visual progress bars and task status
- **Steering Documents** - Quick access to project guidance
- **Dark Mode** - Automatically enabled for better readability

### Dashboard Features
- **Spec Cards** - Overview of each spec with status indicators
- **Document Navigation** - Switch between requirements, design, and tasks
- **Task Management** - View task progress and copy implementation prompts
- **Real-Time Updates** - WebSocket connection for live project status

## Workflow Process

### 1. Project Setup (Recommended)
```
steering-guide â†’ create-steering-doc (product, tech, structure)
```
Creates foundational documents to guide your project development.

### 2. Feature Development
```
spec-workflow-guide â†’ create-spec-doc â†’ [review] â†’ implementation
```
Sequential process: Requirements â†’ Design â†’ Tasks â†’ Implementation

### 3. Implementation Support
- Use `get-spec-context` for detailed implementation context
- Use `manage-tasks` to track task completion
- Monitor progress via the web dashboard

## File Structure

```
your-project/
  .spec-workflow/
    steering/
      product.md        # Product vision and goals
      tech.md          # Technical decisions
      structure.md     # Project structure guide
    specs/
      {spec-name}/
        requirements.md # What needs to be built
        design.md      # How it will be built
        tasks.md       # Implementation breakdown
    approval/
      {spec-name}/
        {document-id}.json # Approval status tracking
```

## Development

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build the project
npm run build

# Run in development mode (with auto-reload)
npm run dev

# Start the production server
npm start

# Clean build artifacts
npm run clean
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Dashboard not opening automatically**
   - The dashboard uses ephemeral ports and opens automatically when the MCP server starts
   - Check console output for the dashboard URL if it doesn't open in your browser

2. **MCP server not connecting**
   - Verify the file paths in your configuration are correct
   - Ensure the project has been built with `npm run build`
   - Check that Node.js is available in your system PATH

3. **Dashboard not updating**
   - The dashboard uses WebSockets for real-time updates
   - Refresh the browser if connection is lost
   - Check console for any JavaScript errors
